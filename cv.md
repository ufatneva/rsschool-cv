## About me
I have a higher education in the field of infocommunication technologies. At the university, we superficially touched on the topic of programming and studied html and css. It was from that moment that I became interested in IT. I once took a course on web development, which gave me basic knowledge of the web. Now I am taking a course in order to improve my knowledge and acquire new ones. My dream is to become a mid-level web developer.
